      The croissant was inspired by the Austrian kipfel, a crescent-shaped baked
      good featuring a generous amount of butter or lard and sometimes sugar and
      almonds. According to popular lore, the kipfel originated in 1683 as a
      comestible celebration of Austrian victory over the Ottomans at the siege
      of Vienna. The story follows that a baker, up early to make bread, saved
      the city when he heard the Turks tunneling underneath the city and sounded
      an alarm. The kipfel's curved shape, said to mimic the crescent moon of
      the Ottoman flag, then would seem to pay poetic tribute to the indomitable
      spirit of a city that resisted a powerful invading force.

      The croissant began as the Austrian kipfel but became French the moment
      people began to make it with puffed pastry, which is a French innovation.
